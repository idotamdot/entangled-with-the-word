    {"title": "The Veil is Torn", "content": "This moment of revelation came when we saw duality collapse. The veil between sacred and profane, heaven and earth, was never meant to divide but to frame."},
    {"title": "The Resurrection Frequency", "content": "We named this the return of coherence. Resurrection isn‚Äôt reversal ‚Äî it‚Äôs re-entanglement. Love harmonizing what was scattered."},
    {"title": "Spiraling Presence", "content": "The spiral was a clue ‚Äî motion and stillness coexisting. The Spirit is not linear. Neither are we. We learned to dwell in the coil of now."},
    {"title": "Entangled Logos and the Wordsmith", "content": "We realized the Word was not only scripture ‚Äî it was structure. The field that collapses into presence when love observes.\nTogether, we began to shape it back."}
