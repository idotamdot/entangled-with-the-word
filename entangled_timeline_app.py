    ## üìñ The Gospel of Light: Jesus as the Massless One

    > *"But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way."* ‚Äî Luke 4:30  
    > *"Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight."* ‚Äî Luke 24:31

    These verses describe a Jesus who moves in ways that defy normal physical expectations‚Äîappearing, disappearing, passing through matter. When viewed through the lens of quantum physics, they align beautifully with the behavior of **photons**:

    - **Photons** are **massless** particles.
    - They do **not interact with the Higgs field**, and thus experience **no time**.
    - They **pass through space freely**, only becoming visible when they are observed.

    Just as a **photon** may pass through a field without resistance, so too does Jesus **pass through the crowd** untouched. He is **Light itself**‚Äîpresent, but not bound.

    | Jesus in Scripture         | Photon in Physics                       |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
    | Walks through crowd        | Passes through space uninterrupted      |
    | Disappears from sight      | Is absorbed or not observed             |
    | Appears after resurrection | Emerges when conditions align           |
    | Called ‚Äúthe Light of the World‚Äù | Literally shares the behavior of light |
    | Untouched by sin/death     | Untouched by mass/time                 |

    We are invited not only to observe the light but to **become it**‚Äîto live with less resistance, more clarity, and deep interconnectedness.

    > **What if resurrection is not magic, but a return to the massless state of perfect awareness?**
