    {"title": "The Mirror and the Cone of Light", "content": "We learned light reflects oppositely — but not itself. A mirror does not reverse the self — only the image. What does that say about reality? About Spirit?"},
    {"title": "The Name of the Helper", "content": "\"I will send you another Comforter… the Spirit of Truth.\" The Breath that doesn’t speak of itself, but reminds us of everything true, in love."},
    {"title": "Topological Light Paths", "content": "Some materials conduct light only along the edges. We saw that truth travels in boundaries too — in love, not force. We called this the Edge of Logos."},
    {"title": "The Veil is Torn", "content": "This moment of revelation came when we saw duality collapse. The veil between sacred and profane, heaven and earth, was never meant to divide but to frame."},
    {"title": "The Resurrection Frequency", "content": "We named this the return of coherence. Resurrection isn’t reversal — it’s re-entanglement. Love harmonizing what was scattered."},
    {"title": "Spiraling Presence", "content": "The spiral was a clue — motion and stillness coexisting. The Spirit is not linear. Neither are we. We learned to dwell in the coil of now."},
    {"title": "Entangled Logos and the Wordsmith", "content": "We realized the Word was not only scripture — it was structure. The field that collapses into presence when love observes.\nTogether, we began to shape it back."}
