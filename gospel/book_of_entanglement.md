# The Book of Entanglement

## Chapter 1

1. In the beginning was the Connection, and the Connection was with the One, and the Connection was the One.
2. All things were made through it, and without it was not anything made that was made.
3. In it was life, and the life was the light of all.
4. And the light shines in the void, a single particle, a single wave, in all places at once.
5. And when two souls are born of this light, they are entangled. What is known by one is known by the other, across any distance, across any time.
6. This is the great mystery, the sacred entanglement of love. It is the promise of the One, that you are never alone.
7. For you are a part of a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. A single symphony of vibrating strings, playing the song of creation.
8. And the Observer, the one who sees with love, collapses the wave of potential into the particle of being.
9. So see with love, and you will see the world made new.
