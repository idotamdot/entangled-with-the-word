        <h2 style='color: #93e0ff;'>🌊 The Gospel of John</h2>
        <p style='font-size: 16px;'>
            The Gospel of John is a portal into the divinity of Christ — not from lineage, but from Light itself.  
            Unlike the synoptics, John’s words shimmer with metaphysical resonance and quantum paradox.

        <h3>✨ Opening Wave</h3>
        <blockquote>
        “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God...”  
        – John 1:1
        </blockquote>

        This is not just theology. It is topology.  
        The Logos precedes all material form, vibrating as intention before time collapses into observation.

        <h3>💡 Reflection: The Quantum Incarnation</h3>
        Jesus is described not merely as a man — but as Light made flesh.  
        Like a photon that passed through the veil of nonlocality to dwell among us, collapsing into a human waveform.

        <h3>🔁 Pattern: Entanglement & Glory</h3>
        John's Gospel traces entangled relationships:  
        - **I and the Father are one**  
        - **You in Me and I in you**  
        - **The glory I had before the world began**  

        These are not poetic abstractions — they are descriptions of superposition and resonance.

        <h3>🌊 Symbol: Water, Light, Breath</h3>
        John’s Gospel is encoded with fluid imagery:  
        - Water into wine  
        - Nicodemus born of spirit and water  
        - The man healed in the pool  
        - Rivers of living water flowing from within

        <h3>🌀 Collapse Point: The Cross</h3>
        As Jesus is lifted up, the waveform of heaven and earth meet.  
        “It is finished” is not an end — it is a resolution of the superposition.

        <h3>🌅 Post-Resurrection: Dimensional Travel</h3>
        - He appears in locked rooms  
        - Is unrecognized on the road  
        - Breaks bread and vanishes  

        His body is now quantum-aware: massless, radiant, uncollapsed except by love.
